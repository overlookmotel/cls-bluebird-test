## Usage

The intention of this repo is to establish, when using promises on node.js, in what circumstances [continuation-local-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/continuation-local-storage) context is maintained, and in what cases it gets lost.

This repo contains tests which:

* Try various different ways of using promises
* Test whether [continuation-local-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/continuation-local-storage) context is maintained or not in all these cases
* Run these tests against various promise implementations

The tests are run against the following Promise implementations:

* Native JS Promise (where available)
* [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) v2.x
* [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) v3.x
* bluebird v2.x with [cls-bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cls-bluebird) shim
* bluebird v3.x with [cls-bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cls-bluebird) shim
* bluebird v3.x with prototype [cls-bluebird2](https://github.com/overlookmotel/cls-bluebird2) shim
* [sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) Promise (another approach to shimming bluebird v3.x)

### Running the tests

Clone this repo then...

```
npm install
npm test
```

### Inspect test results on Travis

Travis CI runs the tests on the following version of node:

* 0.10.x (Native JS Promise is skipped)
* 0.12.x
* 4.x
* 5.x

The results can be viewed at [travis-ci.org/overlookmotel/cls-bluebird-test/](https://travis-ci.org/overlookmotel/cls-bluebird-test/)
